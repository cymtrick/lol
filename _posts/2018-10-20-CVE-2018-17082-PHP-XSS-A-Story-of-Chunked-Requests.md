> ####A Story of mishandling the Chunked Data


When we enter chunked data is registered with proper length, the HTTP engines usually send the process through to language compilers.

First of all, What's a chunked data?

>Chunked transfer encoding is a streaming data transfer mechanism available in version 1.1 of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In chunked transfer encoding, the data stream is divided into a series of non-overlapping "chunks". The chunks are sent out and received independently of one another. No knowledge of the data stream outside the currently-being-processed chunk is necessary for both the sender and the receiver at any given time.

How is the chunk processed? 

>If a Transfer-Encoding field with a value of "chunked" is specified in an HTTP message (either a request sent by a client or the response from the server), the body of the message consists of an unspecified number of chunks, a terminating chunk, trailer, and a final CRLF sequence (i.e. carriage return followed by line feed).
Each chunk starts with the number of octets of the data it embeds expressed as a hexadecimal number in ASCII followed by optional parameters (chunk extension) and a terminating CRLF sequence, followed by the chunk data. The chunk is terminated by CRLF. If chunk extensions are provided, the chunk size is terminated by a semicolon and followed by the parameters,
each also delimited by semicolons.

 What's the problem here with PHP and Apache then ?
 
 See, Apache didn't upgrade to HTTP/2.0, which means still the Chunked Transfer Encoding exists. When header field has the option as
Transfer-Encoding: chunked and improper Content-Length that is more than required. The request body mysteriously appears in the 
 Response body.
 
 The input gets into Apache's "bucket brigade", even though PHP is not sending it there directly 
 (in fact, it never sees the input since Apache doesn't let it to read it, throwing an error in ap_http_filter instead):

So, what's a bucket brigade?

>Buckets

A bucket is a container for data. Buckets can contain any type of data.
Although the most common case is a block of memory, a bucket may instead contain a file on disc, or even be fed a data stream from a dynamic source such as a separate program. 
Different bucket types exist to hold different kinds of data and the methods for handling it. In OOP terms, the apr_bucket is an abstract base class from which actual bucket types are derived.
There are several different types of data bucket, as well as metadata buckets. We will describe these at the end of this article.

>Brigades

In normal use, there is no such thing as a freestanding bucket: they are contained in bucket brigades.
A brigade is a container that may hold any number of buckets in a ring structure. 
The brigade serves to enable flexible and efficient manipulation of data, and is the unit that gets passed to and 
from your filter. 

>Bucket memory gets intialized way above and waits till the chunked data enters into the memory stream before even it is destroyed.
Now, the brigade memory is mishandled into the way of response brigade memory.

Handlers responsible for this vulnerability is sapi_apache2.c:

{% highlight %}

	if (!parent_req) {
		php_apache_request_dtor(r);
		ctx->request_processed = 1;
		bucket = apr_bucket_eos_create(r->connection->bucket_alloc);
		APR_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(brigade, bucket);
		
{% endhighlight %}

Patch:

{% highlight %}

	if (!parent_req) {
		php_apache_request_dtor(r);
		ctx->request_processed = 1;
		bucket = apr_bucket_eos_create(r->connection->bucket_alloc);
    brigade = apr_brigade_create(r->pool, r->connection->bucket_alloc);
		APR_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(brigade, bucket);
		
{% endhighlight %}
